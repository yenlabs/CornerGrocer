# Corner Grocer Project

## Project Overview
The Corner Grocer project is a c++ application designed to analyze grocery item data from an iput file and determine how frequently each item appears. The program allows users to search a specific item, view a complete list of item frequencies, and display a histogram output. The program also generates a back up file ('freguency.dat') that stores each item with its recorded frequency for your records.

## What did I do particularly well?
- Implemented accurate item frequency using the appropiate data structures.
- Designed a clear, menu interface for user interaction.
- Produced multiple output formats, including frequency list and histogram.
- Automatically generated back up file ('frequency.dat') without user intervention.

## Areas from Improvement
Future enhancemnets:
- **Input normalization** to handle case sensitivity and spacing.
- **Improved input validation** to safely handle invalid user input.
- **Refactoring repeated logic in functions** to provide clearer feedback.
- **Performance improvements** such as using more optimized data structure for large data sets.

These changes would improve efficiency, reliability, and overall usability.

## Challenges and Solutions
The most challenging aspect of this project was implementing file input/ouput while making sure there was accurate frequency counts and correct formatted output. This was fixed by debugging, and validating results against the expected outputs. The debugging and validations was essential to be to overcome these challenges.

## Transferable Skills
This project strengthened several skills applicable to my future coarsework and software projects, including:

- File input/output handling
- Data processing and frequency analysis
- Menu driven program design
- Debugging and problem solving in C++
- Writing code that complies to detailed specs

## Maintainability and Readability
The program was written with maintainability in mined by using clear naming conventions, consistent formatting, and logical seperation of responsibilities. The srtuture flowed for easy updates, such as adding new menu options if needed or changing output formats, without the need for significant changes to the existing code.
